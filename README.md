# Week 4 Project - Google Books App

Book searcher and reader iOS App using the Google Books API

## Build The Project

1. Clone or download the project
2. The project uses [CocoaPods]. The dependencies are embedded within the repository, so it's not neccessary to run `pods install`

## Run The Project

Open the file `GoogleBooks.xcworkspace` on Xcode

## Requirements

- [x] Inputs. Give the user a search box to enter the book to be searched (tableView screen)
